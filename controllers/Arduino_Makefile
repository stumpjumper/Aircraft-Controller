# NOTES:
# 1) Need to do a
#    make -f Arduino_Makefile ...
#    since this file is not named "Makefile"
# 2) Need to run make in the directory with the *.ino file
#    So need to do a make arduino_links, cd to, say, F-6,  then do a
#    ln -s ../Arduino_Makefile Makefile
#    make
# 3) To find the serial port do a 
#    "dmesg | grep tty" and look at last serial port added.
#    Usually looks something like /dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyUSB0
#    and is at the bottom of the grep output.

#   (adjust the board tag to suit your arduino)
# 
#   'make' will compile the sketch
#   'make upload' will compile and upload
#   'make monitor' will connect to the Arduino's serial port (^A-k gets you out!)
#   'make help' will tell you other stuff
#   reading /usr/share/arduino/Arduino.mk will tell you still more stuff.
