Free dynamic memory in bytes
B-29
====
1066:
1088: from combining Light and OnOffLight
1095: from getting ride of two variables that were size_t, made them uint8_t
1095: after deleting on/off/saveState and moveto code.  Looks like compiler is good at optimizing out unused code
1095: after some minor code weeks in printing, including saving millis() to const variable and using 4 times
1091: after adding support for timeoutUpdateLights.  Added a uint32_t and some logic
1084: after changing formation and illumination from DelayLight to Light and landing from Light to DelayLight and adding control parameters for landing, which adds 2 uint32_t and 1 uint8_t (9 bytes)

F-16:
1067: First version based on B-29.ino and loaded onto aircraft.
